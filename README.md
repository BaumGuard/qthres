# qthres<br />

With this small commandline tool written in java you can resolve a maidenhead locator and calculate the distance to it from your QTH. You can also enter a callsign and qthres will resolve its locator from qrzcq.com. Furthermore, qthres also has the ability to show the position and the distance of your locator/callsign on a map. There is also the possibility to convert coordinates into a locator.<br />
<br />
<br />
**Dependencies**<br />
`JRE` and `Firefox` need to be installed on your system.
<br />
<br />
**Installation**<br />
Just execute the following command in the commandline:<br />
`cd && git clone https://www.github.com/BaumGuard/qthres && echo "alias qthres='java -jar ~/qthres/qthres.jar'" >> ~/.bashrc && nano ~/qthres/qth.txt && exec bash`<br />
Replace `0.0,0.0` by the coordinates (lat,lon) or the locator (more inaccurate results) of your QTH. Make sure there are no spaces in the line.<br />
<br />
<br />
**How to use**<br />
`qthres [locator/callsign/coordinates(lat,lon)] [options]`<br />

csrsl comes with four options which you can add after the locator/callsign:<br />
`help`: shows the help dialog<br />
`map`: displays the locator/callsign and the distance on a map (luftlinie.org)<br />
`nodist`: Only show coordinates<br />
`distonly`: Only show distance<br />
`imp`: Use miles for the distance instead of km<br />
`swap`: Output the coordinates in the format lon,lat<br />

Of course, you can also use more than one option.<br />
